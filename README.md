---
## Usage 

Follow the following steps below to configure and deploy your AWS - ECS Fargate Workflow using the **Ops CLI** commands. 

### Build Pipelines 

In your application, build your Docker image, from your Dockerfile, and your `ops.yml` file located in the specified path you created in your source directory using the `ops build .` command.

- [Check out the documentation to learn more on building pipelines](https://cto.ai/docs/aws-ecs-fargate#ecs--fargate-workflow-pipelines)

### Run Pipelines

Next, create the running containers from the image, and start it using `ops run .`

- [Learn more about running pipelines](https://cto.ai/docs/aws-ecs-fargate#run-pipelines-locally-with-the-ctoai-cli)

### Set up your Infrastructure 

Next, set up your AWS infrastructure to build, and run your AWS-ECS-Fargate workflow using the `ops run -b .` the command will provision your AWS ECS and Fargate stack using CloudFormation.

- [Check out the documentation to learn more.](https://cto.ai/docs/aws-ecs-fargate#run-and-set-up-your-infrastructure)

### Build and Publish Services 

After building pipelines and setting up your infrastructure, you can enable service previews on your application by building your services using `ops build .`

- [Learn more on building services](https://cto.ai/docs/aws-ecs-fargate#build-services-locally-with-the-ctoai-cli)

### Publish Services 

Next, publish your service workflow using `ops publish .` to run your microservice web application over HTTP. 

---

### Trigger your Pipelines and Services

When you are done building and publishing your Pipelines and Services, you can trigger them using [GitHub Event Triggers](https://cto.ai/docs/how-to-use-events#supported-event-triggers). Trigger your [pipelines](https://cto.ai/docs/aws-ecs-fargate#trigger-pipelines-using-events) and [services](https://cto.ai/docs/aws-ecs-fargate#trigger-services-using-events) using event triggers like `pull_request_merged` `create.tag`
